# Nik300.InterpretLayer
## Introduction
This layer aims at making it easier for developers to <b>create</b> their own <b>programming language</b>. <br/>
This is basically the interpreter of an abstract language, designed to be flexible and adaptable to any kind of parser.

## How to use
That being said, the interpreter is in a very early stage and doesn't support anything, but a debug statement you can try yourself (check out the code in TestOS/Kernel.cs). <br/>
I hope to implement some basic staff asap for you to enjoy CosmosOS at its full potential with external libraries and executables. <br/>
